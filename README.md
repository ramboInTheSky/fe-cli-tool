# Frontend CLI tool

##
This CLI tool is trying to bring consistency throughout Amido projects. At the moment it has a boilerplate generation functionality for `React ducks, components, compositions`.

But hopefully we can extend it further.

## Install

```
npm i -g https://github.com/amido/fe-cli-tool.git
```

## Usage

To use the tool, you need to be in a project directory and you can run one of the following commands from there:

```
amido make:duck <name>
amido make:component <name>
amido make:composition <name>
```
